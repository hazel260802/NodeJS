## Introduction

This project demonstrates the creation of RESTful APIs using Node.js. It provides a basic structure and examples that can be used as a starting point for building APIs in Node.js.

## Features

- Basic authentication and authorization for API endpoints.
- CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for resources.
- Express.js framework for routing and handling requests.
- MongoDB integration for data storage.

## Requirements

- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- MongoDB (version X.X.X)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/hazel260802/NodeJS.git
   cd NodeJS
   cd restapis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the server:

```
 npm start
```

## Usage

Once the server is up and running, you can access the API endpoints using tools like curl or Postman. Make sure to include proper authentication headers as required.
## Endpoints

- **GET /api/items**: Get a list of items.
- **GET /api/items/:id**: Get details of a specific item.
- **POST /api/items**: Create a new item.
- **PUT /api/items/:id**: Update an existing item.
- **DELETE /api/items/:id**: Delete an item.


For more details on request and response formats, authentication, and usage of endpoints, refer to the API documentation.
